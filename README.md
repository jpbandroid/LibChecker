## What's this?
This app is used to view the third-party libraries used by applications in your device. It can view the ABI architecture of the application's native library (in general, whether the application is 64-bit or 32-bit). It can also view well-known libraries marked by [The Rule Repository](https://github.com/jpbandroid/LibChecker-Rules), and can even sort and view them according to the number of libraries references.
